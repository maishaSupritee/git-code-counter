    <h1>Privacy Policy for GitHub Code Counter</h1>

    <p>Last Updated: 9th April, 2025</p>

    <p>
      GitHub Code Counter is a browser extension that counts lines of code in
      GitHub repositories. This privacy policy explains what information we
      collect and how we use it.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>Our extension collects the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>GitHub Personal Access Token (optional):</strong> If provided by
        you, we store this token locally on your device to authenticate API
        requests to GitHub. This helps avoid rate limiting and enables access to
        your private repositories. The token is automatically deleted after one
        hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cached Repository Data:</strong> The extension temporarily
        stores repository data in your browser's local storage to improve
        performance and reduce API calls to GitHub. This cache is automatically
        cleared after one hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>File Extension Exclusion Preferences:</strong> Your preferences
        for excluding certain file types from code counting are stored locally.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. They
      are stored only on the current chrome window you are using, and not across
      multiple windows of your browser. No data is sent to our servers or any
      third parties other than GitHub's API.
    </p>

    <h2>GitHub API Usage</h2>
    <p>
      This extension makes requests to the GitHub API to retrieve repository
      data. These requests are subject to GitHub's own
      <a

        target="_blank"
        >Privacy Statement</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Cached repository data and the Github personal token, is automatically
      cleared after one hour. Your extension preferences remain stored until you
      explicitly remove them or uninstall the extension.
    </p>
