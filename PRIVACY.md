# Privacy Policy for GitHub Code Counter

Last Updated: 9th April, 2025

GitHub Code Counter is a browser extension that counts lines of code in GitHub repositories. This privacy policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.

## Information Collection

Our extension collects the following information:

- GitHub Personal Access Token (optional): If provided by you, we store this token locally on your device to authenticate API requests to GitHub. This helps avoid rate limiting and enables access to your private repositories. The token is automatically deleted after one hour.
- Cached Repository Data: The extension temporarily stores repository data in your browser's local storage to improve performance and reduce API calls to GitHub. This cache is automatically cleared after one hour.
- File Extension Exclusion Preferences: Your preferences for excluding certain file types from code counting are stored locally.

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. They are stored only on the current chrome window you are using, and not across multiple windows of your browser. No data is sent to our servers or any third parties other than GitHub's API.

## GitHub API Usage

This extension makes requests to the GitHub API to retrieve repository data. These requests are subject to GitHub's own Privacy Statement.

## Data Retention

Cached repository data and the Github personal token, is automatically cleared after one hour. Your extension preferences remain stored until you explicitly remove them or uninstall the extension.
